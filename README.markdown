What is this?
-------------
This is the code base for the Salina Street Church website. The current site at [salinastreetchurch.com][Salina] will eventually be replaced with a new site based on this code. We're still working on getting things to version 1.0, so this is not really a usable chunk of code yet.


Why is this code on GitHub
--------------------------
1. We needed a way for multiple people to collaborate on the code
2. GitHub is free and easy
3. Maybe some other church or organization can benefit from our code being open source


Server Admin Checklist
----------------------
The following things need to be installed for this code to work correctly.

* Python 2.6
* Django 1.1
* MySQL
* Python Extensions
  - MySQLdb
  - Markdown

We're planning on using DreamHost to host the site (they offer [free hosting][FreeHosting] for non profits!), so this article on [setting up Django with DreamHost][DreamHostDjango] will likely be useful.
